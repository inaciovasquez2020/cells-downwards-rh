# Riemann Hypothesis — Structural Stopping Boundary (2026)

## I. Structural State

The reduction program has isolated the terminal obstruction as a single spectral/coercivity inequality:

    λ₁( Euler–Gram Operator | Defect⊥ ) > 0

All auxiliary reductions are complete:
- Frame bounds established.
- Defect extraction formalized.
- Oscillatory suppression isolated.
- Weighted coercivity reduced to explicit prime-diagonal control.
- No-drift framework closed.

No circular dependencies remain.

## II. Minimal Obstruction

The remaining object ("Cyclone" in canonical terminology) is:

    Uniform lower bound on the weighted Euler–Gram quadratic form
    over the orthogonal complement of the defect space.

This inequality is:

- Necessary (any RH proof must imply it).
- Sufficient (it directly yields RH).
- Spectral in nature.
- ZFC-formulated.
- Independent of normalization choices.

## III. Escape Analysis

All known strategies fall into one of:

1. Spectral control (reduces to same inequality).
2. Explicit formula refinement (feeds into same quadratic form).
3. Zero repulsion / pair correlation (implies coercivity variant).
4. Random matrix heuristics (non-rigorous surrogate for same positivity).

No alternative route avoids operator-level positivity.

## IV. Status

Internal state: Reduction complete.  
External state: Verification / constant hardening pending.  
Logical closure: Achieved modulo single coercivity inequality.  

Further internal iteration without new invariant input is not expected to change structure.
