# Quick Contributions

You can help by:

1. Re-running eigenvalue scaling on larger grids.
2. Testing alternative weight functions.
3. Adding asymptotic regression checks.
4. Verifying monotonicity numerically.
5. Stress-testing boundary projection logic.

Run:

    ./verify.sh

All contributions must preserve PASS state.
